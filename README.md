# btrfs-diff-go

Analyze differences between two BTRFS snapshots (like
[GNU diff](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/) for directories).

It is a single GO script (package) of ~ 540 lines of code (without blanks and comments), plus a main
script (binary) of 95 loc.

## USAGE

This is the output of `btrfs-diff --help` :

```text

btrfs-diff - Analyse the differences between two related btrfs subvolumes.

USAGE

    btrfs-diff [ --debug ] PARENT CHILD
        Analyse the difference between btrfs PARENT and CHILD.

    btrfs-diff [ --debug ] -f|--file STREAM
        Analyse the differences from a STREAM file (output from 'btrfs send').

    btrfs-diff [ -h | --help ]
        Display help.

ARGUMENTS

    PARENT
        A btrfs subvolume that is the parent of the CHILD one.

    CHILD
        A btrfs subvolume that is the child of the PARENT one.

OPTIONS

    -h | --help
        Display help.

    --debug
        Be more verbose.

    -f|--file STREAM
        Use a STREAM file to get the btrfs operations.
        This stream file must have been generated by the command
        'btrfs send' (with or without the option --no-data).

EXAMPLES

    Get the differences between two snapshots.
    $ btrfs-diff /backup/btrfs-sp/rootfs/2020-12-25_22h00m00.shutdown.safe \
        /backup/btrfs-sp/rootfs/2019-12-25_21h00m00.shutdown.safe

## Installation

First, install the required dependencies (example for *Debian* / *Ubuntu*)

```sh
~> sudo apt install golang libbtrfs-dev
```

### Using `go get` command

Use the convenient `go get` :

```sh
~> sudo go get https://github.com/mbideau/btrfs-diff-go
```

That will create a binary named _btrfs-diff-go_ in `$GOPATH/bin`.

### Building from the sources

Clone the repository, run the build then install it

```sh
~> git clone -q https://github.com/mbideau/btrfs-diff-go.git
~> cd btrfs-diff-go
~> go build -v
~> go install
```

### Copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin` to make it available system wide

And rename it to `btrfs-diff`, if you don't care about the implementation language.

```sh
~> [ "$GOPATH" != '' ] || GOPATH="$HOME/go"
~> sudo cp $GOPATH/bin/btrfs-diff-go /usr/local/bin/btrfs-diff
~> sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/btrfs-diff
```


## Fast diff between BTRFS snapshots

### Why ? Reason to be

The great advantage of having a [COW filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) with
snapshoting like BTRFS is that producing the differences between two snapshots is almost
instantaneous.

For example, you can get the differences between *snap1* and *snap2* with the following command :

```sh
~> btrfs send --quiet --no-data -p snap1 snap2 | LC_ALL=C btrfs receive --quiet --dump > /tmp/btrfs.dump
```

Note that this dump is not really human readable. Moreover it contains operations, not differences.
So it is not exactly what we are looking for. For example it might contains transient object
informations, and multiple lines of unintuitive operations to reproduce a file state.

I wanted a differences file format like the one you have when doing `diff -rq` or
`git status --goort`, in short: a human friendly one.

I looked at the prior art (see below), but nothing were satisfying enough, so I rolled my own
diff utility (which produce the stream with `btrfs send` and then parse it).

### Prior art analysis

As the time of writing this (i.e.: Dec. 2020), I have found 2 projects matching `btrfs diff`
in *Github* and 0 in *Gitlab*.

* [btrfs-send-go](https://github.com/bucko909/btrfs-send-go) [GO]  
  The one that this project have extended, fixed and improved.  
  The original author's version is raw, and have minor bugs, but does exactly the job.  
  It is also not translatable (as-is).

* [btrfs-snapshots-diff](https://github.com/sysnux/btrfs-snapshots-diff) [Python 2]  
  It has a lot of issues (with link, but not only), and is Python 2, which is deprecated by now.  
  No go.

* [btrfs-snapshots-diff](https://github.com/daviessm/btrfs-snapshots-diff)  [Python 3]  
  A fork of the previous one, with a lot of issues fixed and in *Python 3*.  
  Because it is written in *Python*, it means that if I want to run it in *initram* (I do) I
  will need to include the *Python* binary and the required dependencies. Too much for what I
  want.  
  May be I could compile it with *Cython*, but I am not (yet) comfortable with that.

There is also the [snapper](https://github.com/openSUSE/snapper) utility that compares BTRFS
snapshots, but it does so by mounting both snapshots and doing a "standard" `diff` on them (if my
understanding is correct).

Finally I have found a lot of small Python script doing a BTRFS diff, but they were using a
hacky way to do it (based on the `find-new` method), without being able to catch deletions.  
They were better-than-nothing prior to `btrfs send` and `btrfs receive`, but they are obsolete
since. Hence, I skipped all those.

So, I almost found what I wanted, after patching/fixing *btrfs-send-go* but I was not confident
enough to trust it, and it still lacked the translation layer.

This is why I first decided to roll my own script, in POSIX shell, that have all the features I
was looking for. See [btrfs-diff-sh](https://github.com/mbideau/btrfs-diff-sh).

But after being happy with it, it was a little bit too slow, so I decided to go back to the go
version (pun intented) and fix its bug and improve its user experience.

Here it is. Way faster than the shell version. Not measured yet (it's a feeling).

#### Features list

Cool features implemented :

* can produce the raw diff from two snapshots or parse a raw stream file
* produces an output close to the `diff -rq` utility and `git status --goort`
* fast

#### Limits / flaws

It does the job, but have some limits.

It was not tested on huge dumps, so it might not perform well or reveal majors bugs.

Due to BTRFS implementation, some files appear as *changed*, when they are not (according to
`diff` utility). I have absolutely no idea why BTRFS is acting like this… If someone can
help me figures this out, I'll be glad.


## Feedbacks wanted, PR/MR welcome :heart:

If you have any question or wants to share your uncovered case, please I be glad to answer and
accept changes through *Pull Request*.


## Developing

Do your changes, then, in the source directory, run :  

```sh
~> go build -v
```

## Testing

And to be sure that the program is working in your environment, or that you have not broken
anything while developing, you have to run the tests.

Then you can run the following command:  

```sh
~> sh test.sh
```

It is very raw but it test already a lot of cases.


## TODO

By order of priority :

* [ ] customize the Github *test* action to have a btrfs filesystem (in a file and mounted to a
  writable path)
* [ ] add a *test: pass* badge when the test will be able to pass
* [ ] make the program translatable
* [ ] create a Github action to automaticaly insert the help into the README from the exectuion of
  the command
* [ ] create a Github action to generate a table of links to the sections at the top of the README
* [ ] create an alpha release when the program would have received enough testing (and possibly
  real life conditions runs)
